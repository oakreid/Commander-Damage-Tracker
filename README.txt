This is a small Android App being developed based on the code of Oakley Reid's Original Commander Damage Tracker with small changes and also to help us understand github's difference between forks and collaborators...work in progress!

Anyway, compiling and creating a .apk of this code will create a small app that can support up to four players in a multiplayer commander game with individual casting counts and commander damage trackers on the bottom of each player.

V2.0:
There is now a reset button in the middle of the screen!
